#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Kerry and Seth paired together. It took about four hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on ... the meta tag declaration.  We settled on the industry standard of 1 for initial scale and used the recommended 640px for a mobile viewport.
  2. Next, we ... added the also industry standard normalize.css codeblock and linked it in our index.html as well as the same for our icons.css and the SMACSS-guided base.css, layout.css, and module.css.
  3. Lastly we added our div class of "icon-menu" which displayed our hamburger menu.  We also decided to match the scale of the menu icon to the comp-image where we landed at a font-size of 300%.
